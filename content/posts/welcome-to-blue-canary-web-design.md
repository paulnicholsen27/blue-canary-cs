### Introducing Blue Canary Web Design: Websites That Actually Work 

![blue canary logo](/assets/images/uploads/horiz_rt_fulllogo_transparent.png)

Let’s start with an uncomfortable truth.
A lot of small business websites are not doing their jobs.

They load slowly. They confuse visitors. They look fine on a laptop and completely fall apart on a phone. And worst of all, they quietly lose customers while their owners assume the site is “good enough.”

That problem is exactly why **Blue Canary Web Design** exists.

I started Blue Canary because I’ve spent years building, fixing, and redesigning websites and kept seeing the same thing over and over again. Smart people. Good businesses. Websites that were holding them back instead of helping them grow.

Blue Canary Web Design focuses on **clear, fast, accessible websites for small businesses**. No bloated features you do not need. No confusing jargon. No disappearing after launch. Just thoughtful design, clean code, and ongoing support when you need it.

And yes, we are intentionally small.
That is not a limitation. It is the point.

When you work with Blue Canary, you are not handed off to a ticketing system or a rotating cast of developers. You work directly with me. I pay attention. I learn how your business actually works. I notice the details that matter, because the details are what make a website effective.

We build sites that:

* Load quickly and pass Lighthouse and accessibility checks
* Look great on phones, tablets, and desktops
* Are easy for real humans to navigate
* Are structured to help search engines understand your business
* Grow with you instead of needing a rebuild every year

We also believe that doing good business matters. Blue Canary proudly offers discounted rates to organizations that support democracy, equality, and kindness. Small choices add up, and this is one way we try to make ours count.

If you are launching a new business, refreshing an outdated site, or finally ready to fix the one that has been quietly bothering you for years, you are in the right place.

A better website really can start here.
And yes, it can even be an enjoyable process.
